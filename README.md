# Building _pretty_ fast websites

This is a Reveal.js presentation I made for work. The website is live
at https://pretty-fast-websites.vercel.app/ so I made the code public
as well.

There's no build pipeline, the build step just copies reveal.js from 
`node_modules` to a vendor folder that the server can access.
